### 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how I implemented a **Gaussian (Normal) distribution fitting algorithm** entirely **from scratch** using **Python and NumPy**.
Rather than relying on pre-built machine learning tools, I manually derived and coded the **gradient descent optimization** process to fit the model parameters (mean and standard deviation) to real height data.

It’s a concise yet powerful demonstration of how optimization and probability theory come together in practical data modeling.

### ⚙️ Project Goal

To fit a **Gaussian model** to empirical height data by minimizing the squared difference between the observed histogram and the model’s probability density function using **steepest descent**.

### 📈 Results

* The algorithm successfully converges toward optimal parameters (μ and σ) that closely fit the histogram of height data.
* Visualizations show:

  * The initial and final Gaussian curve over the histogram.
  * The optimization trajectory in the (μ, σ) parameter space.

**Example outcome:**

| Parameter   | Initial | Final  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| μ (mean)    | 155     | ≈167.5 |
| σ (std dev) | 6       | ≈7.8   |
